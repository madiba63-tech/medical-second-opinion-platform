# Authentication Fix Testing Guide

## Root Cause Analysis Summary

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED:** Race condition in AuthContext initialization causing authentication state to reset after successful login.

**ROOT CAUSE:** The AuthContext's `useEffect` was using an aggressive 1-second timeout that would set `loading: false` before the async API call to `/api/v1/auth/me` could complete and properly set the user state.

**SYMPTOMS:**
- Login API succeeds (200 response)  
- Token stored in localStorage correctly
- Profile API succeeds (200 response)
- Dashboard still shows "Authentication Required"
- Console shows: `CustomerLayout render - loading: true, user: false`

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Removed Race Condition in AuthContext
- **BEFORE:** Aggressive timeout forced `loading: false` after 1 second regardless of API state
- **AFTER:** `setLoading(false)` only called in `finally` block after user state is determined

### 2. Improved State Management Flow
- **BEFORE:** Multiple competing timeouts and unclear state transitions
- **AFTER:** Clear, sequential state management with proper error handling

### 3. Removed Unnecessary CustomerLayout Timeout
- **BEFORE:** Additional 500ms timeout to "force" layout rendering
- **AFTER:** Clean rendering based on actual auth state

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Login Flow
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Enter credentials: `test@example.com` / `password123`
3. Click Login
4. **EXPECTED:** Immediate redirect to `/portal` showing dashboard content
5. **EXPECTED:** Console should show successful authentication logs

### 2. Test Authentication Persistence
1. After successful login, refresh the page
2. **EXPECTED:** Dashboard loads immediately without showing "Authentication Required"
3. **EXPECTED:** No race conditions in console logs

### 3. Test Navigation
1. While logged in, navigate to different portal pages
2. Return to `/portal`
3. **EXPECTED:** Dashboard loads consistently without authentication prompts

## Console Log Expectations

### Successful Flow:
```
AuthContext: Starting initialization...
AuthContext: Token from localStorage: true
AuthContext: Calling /api/v1/auth/me to get user profile
AuthContext: /api/v1/auth/me response: {success: true, data: {...}}
AuthContext: Setting user data from profile endpoint
AuthContext: Auth initialization complete - user authenticated
CustomerLayout render - loading: false user: true
```

### Failed Authentication:
```
AuthContext: Starting initialization...
AuthContext: No token found, setting loading to false
CustomerLayout render - loading: false user: false
```

## Files Modified

1. `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Fixed race condition and improved state management
2. `/src/components/customer/CustomerLayout.tsx` - Removed unnecessary timeout logic

## Technical Details

**Key Changes Made:**
- Removed aggressive 1-second timeout in AuthContext
- Used `finally` block to ensure `setLoading(false)` happens after state is determined
- Improved error handling with explicit `setUser(null)` calls
- Added `response.ok` check for better HTTP status validation
- Cleaned up CustomerLayout timeout mechanisms

The fix addresses the root cause by ensuring authentication state is never in an inconsistent state during the initialization process.
