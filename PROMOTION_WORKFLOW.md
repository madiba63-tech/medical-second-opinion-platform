# Development to Staging Promotion Workflow

This document outlines the comprehensive promotion workflow and tooling for safely moving changes from development to staging environments.

## 🚀 Promotion Workflow Overview

The promotion process follows a rigorous, automated pipeline that ensures code quality, security, and reliability before deployment to staging.

### Workflow Stages

1. **🔍 Pre-flight Validation** - Git status, uncommitted changes, branch verification
2. **🧪 Development Testing** - Comprehensive test suite on development environment
3. **💾 Staging Backup** - Full backup of current staging state for rollback capability
4. **🛑 Staging Shutdown** - Graceful shutdown of current staging services
5. **🚀 Staging Deployment** - Deployment of new code to staging environment
6. **✅ Staging Verification** - Health checks and smoke tests on new staging deployment
7. **🔙 Automatic Rollback** - Automatic rollback on any failure with full restoration

- ⚙️ **Configuration Settings**: Environment-specific settings validation
- 🚩 **Feature Flags**: Development vs. production feature differences
- ⚡ **Performance Metrics**: Response time comparison
- 📋 **Readiness Assessment**: Overall promotion readiness score

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run comprehensive comparison
./scripts/compare-environments.sh

# View detailed comparison log
cat /tmp/env-comparison-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log
```

**Readiness Scoring**:
- **90%+**: ✅ Ready for promotion
- **75-89%**: ⚠️ Promotion with caution
- **<75%**: ❌ Not ready for promotion

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Promotion Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Promotion Validation

1. **Environment Status Check**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/status-dev.sh
   ./scripts/compare-environments.sh
   ```

2. **Development Testing**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-promotion.sh development
   ```

3. **Code Quality Verification**:
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Verify no uncommitted changes
   - Confirm latest commit is tested

### Phase 2: Promotion Execution

4. **Automated Promotion**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/promote-to-staging.sh
   ```

5. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Monitor promotion logs
   - Watch for any error indicators
   - Verify backup creation

### Phase 3: Post-Promotion Validation

6. **Staging Validation**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-promotion.sh staging
   ```

7. **Manual Testing**:
   - Frontend functionality testing
   - Critical user flows validation
   - Admin panel verification

8. **Performance Verification**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/compare-environments.sh
   ```

## 🛡️ Safety Mechanisms

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

The promotion script automatically triggers rollback if:
- ❌ Development tests fail
- ❌ Staging deployment fails
- ❌ Health checks don't pass within 5 minutes
- ❌ Critical services are unresponsive
- ❌ Database connectivity issues

### Backup Strategy

**What Gets Backed Up**:
- 💾 Current Git commit hash
- 🗄️ Complete staging database dump
- ⚙️ Environment configuration files
- 📊 Current staging metrics snapshot

**Backup Location**: `/tmp/staging-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`

### Rollback Process

When rollback is triggered:
1. 🛑 Stop current staging services
2. 🔙 Restore previous Git commit
3. 🗄️ Restore database from backup
4. ⚙️ Restore configuration files
5. 🚀 Restart staging with previous version
6. ✅ Verify rollback success

## 📊 Monitoring and Logging

### Log Files

| Log File | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `promotion-*.log` | Main promotion workflow | `/tmp/` |
| `promotion-tests-*.log` | Test execution results | `/tmp/` |
| `env-comparison-*.log` | Environment comparison | `/tmp/` |
| `dev-*.log` | Development service logs | `/tmp/` |

### Key Metrics Tracked

- **Response Times**: API and frontend performance
- **Service Health**: Availability and operational status
- **Database Health**: Connection and query performance
- **Error Rates**: Application and system errors
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU utilization

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Promotion Failures

**Issue**: Development tests fail
- **Solution**: Fix issues in development before re-attempting promotion
- **Command**: `./scripts/test-promotion.sh development`

**Issue**: Staging services won't start
- **Solution**: Check service logs and dependencies
- **Command**: Check `/tmp/promotion-*.log` for detailed errors

**Issue**: Database backup fails
- **Solution**: Verify database connectivity and permissions
- **Command**: Test database connection manually

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Staging slower than development
- **Solution**: Check resource allocation and database optimization
- **Command**: `./scripts/compare-environments.sh`

**Issue**: Services taking too long to start
- **Solution**: Increase timeout values or optimize service startup
- **Location**: Modify timeouts in promotion scripts

## 🔧 Customization and Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Promotion script configuration
PROMOTION_LOG="/tmp/promotion-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log"
BACKUP_DIR="/tmp/staging-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# Timeout configuration
MAX_STARTUP_WAIT=300  # 5 minutes
HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT=30  # 30 seconds
```

### Custom Test Addition

To add custom tests to the promotion workflow:

1. Create test function in `test-promotion.sh`
2. Add to test function array
3. Update documentation

### Service Configuration

Each service can be configured with specific:
- Health check endpoints
