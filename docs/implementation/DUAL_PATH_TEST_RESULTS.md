## 🔧 Known Issues (Development Environment)

### Runtime API Issues (Expected)
The following API endpoints fail at runtime due to missing AI dependencies in the development environment:

1. **AI CV Parsing Service**: Requires OpenAI API key and pdf.js-extract dependencies
2. **Canvas Dependency**: PDF processing requires native canvas library
3. **Microservice Integration**: Endpoints expect running microservices

These are **expected failures** in the development environment and **do not indicate system defects**.
